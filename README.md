### About
This project was a remix of a remix. Thank you to [MadLittleMods](https://github.com/MadLittleMods/airflow-fluid-simulator) and [Dean Alex](http://neuroid.co.uk/lab/fluid/} for making this possible. And to my high school teacher Mr. Pettibone for further explaining the physics to be and helping me make by own modifications.
